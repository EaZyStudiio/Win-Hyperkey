# Win-Hyperkey

![Hyperkey boom2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/957f22dc-c990-4216-a3ac-48b60db3394c)

One of the few features I missed from the poweruser macOS world is my hyperkey solution . It allows users to litterary create a new modifier key "an extremaly easy one at that". Windows on the other hand, does not have good 3rd party solutions "well AHK but... I litterary got that just to make this fuctionality ðŸ˜“ & am litterary known as a poweruser" anyways this handy new feature/additon is here! and almost done the right way...


I am aware that several not really built for a hyperkey alternatives, available on the Internet but I still decided to craft another one by myself.

 ### âœ… What You Get:
  - A new modifer key just hold capslock and any other key on the keyboard (fuction buttons F1, F2, not supporte currently I'll fix that soon)
  - IMPORTANTLY never lose your capslock fuctionality, CAPSLOCK still function as it should if you press it or hold it "doesn't matter really just use it as you always do ðŸ¥³"

### ðŸ”° Coming soon

  - Update to use right hand side CTRL, SHIFT, ALT to trigger the Hyperkey this will allow for even more powerful combinations
  - GUI
    - Allows for mapping new keys (F1, F2, F16 or even unknown keys)
    - Toggle for cords (stuff like volumes)
    - Toogle for exact matches



### Known issues:
  - The entire implementation without loseing CAPSLOCK means in some "minority" softwares you can't create the hotkey you want using capslock and modifierkey
    - just to be clear this works with almost all software current culplrit is Powertoys
  - Since it is combining multiple keyboard modifier keys together you can't really use it in conjunction with other modifier key
    - (SOLUTION) combine from the right side insted
